# LINE REVIEW LOG (WRITER)

## v0.1 English bank (366 lines)
Checks run: scripts/validate_lines.py (JSON, ids, <=90 chars, declared and allowed slots) plus a local script for banned words, affectionate-insult gating (roast >= 2 and bondMin >= 1) and repeated openings within a trigger/category.

Rewritten (not cut):
- About 25 lines that shared their first two words with a neighbour in the same trigger/category (for example several "{minutes} minutes on {app}." openers). The slot or the joke now comes later in the sentence.
- A bible example that used a death-adjacent word was replaced before it reached the bank.

Cut: none yet. No tester feedback exists. Retire or rewrite lines here once the Manager relays "annoying" or 😴 patterns.

Not yet checked: ENGINE's :engine:validateLines (does not exist yet) and the real trigger x category coverage table.
